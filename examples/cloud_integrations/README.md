# Cloud Integrations Examples

This directory contains advanced, self-contained examples for integrating SerenadeFlow with various cloud services (e.g., Google Cloud Storage, Firestore via HTTP API, AWS, etc.).

**Key Principles:**
- All cloud-specific logic is isolated here as examples.
- Use public endpoints or HTTP APIs for remote data access.
- Each example should be self-contained and not affect the core pipeline or other examples.

Add your own integration examples here as needed!
